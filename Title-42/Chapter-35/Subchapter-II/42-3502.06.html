Petitions and voluntary agreements pending as of August 5, 2006, shall be decided pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter in effect prior to August 5, 2006, and may be implemented in accordance with <a href='/dccode/Title-42/Chapter-35/Subchapter-II/42-3502.08.html'>§ 42-3502.08(g)</a>. In considering a hardship petition pursuant to <a href='/dccode/Title-42/Chapter-35/Subchapter-II/42-3502.12.html'>§ 42-3502.12</a>, any unimplemented rent charged increase pursuant to a petition or voluntary agreement approved by the Rent Administrator shall be included in the maximum possible rental income. Except to the extent provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, no housing provider of any rental unit subject to this chapter may charge or collect rent for the rental unit in excess of the amount computed by adding to the base rent not more than all rent increases authorized after April 30, 1985, for the rental unit by this chapter, by prior rent control laws and any administrative decision under those laws, and by a court of competent jurisdiction. No tenant may sublet a rental unit at a rent greater than that tenant pays the housing provider.</span>

This adjustment of general applicability shall be equal to the change during the previous calendar year, ending each December 31, in the Washington, D.C., Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) for all items during the preceding calendar year. No adjustment of general applicability shall exceed 10%. A housing provider may not implement an adjustment of general applicability, or an adjustment permitted by subsection (c) of this section for a rental unit within 12 months of the effective date of the previous adjustment of general applicability, or instead, an adjustment permitted by subsection (c) of this section in the rent charged for that unit.</span>

Such a petition shall be clearly identified as an election instead of the general adjustments authorized by subsection (b) of this section. The Rent Administrator shall accord an expedited review process for these petitions and shall issue and publish a final decision within 90 days after the petition has been filed. In the case of any petition filed under this subsection as to which a final decision has not been rendered by the Rent Administrator at the end of 90 days from the date of filing of the petition and as to which the housing provider is not in default in complying with any information request made under <a href='/dccode/Title-42/Chapter-35/Subchapter-II/42-3502.16.html'>§ 42-3502.16</a>, the rent charged adjustment requested in the petition may be conditionally implemented by the housing provider at the end of the 90-day period. The conditional rent charged adjustment shall be subject to subsequent modification by the final decision of the Rent Administrator on the petition. If a hearing has been held on the petition, the Rent Administrator shall, by order served upon the parties at least 10 days prior to the expiration of the 90 days, make a provisional finding as to the rent charged adjustment justified by the order, if any. Except to the extent modified by this section, the adjustment procedures of <a href='/dccode/Title-42/Chapter-35/Subchapter-II/42-3502.16.html'>§ 42-3502.16</a> shall apply to any adjustment.</span>
