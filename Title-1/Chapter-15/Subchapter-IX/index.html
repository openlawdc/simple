                    <span class="" style="">As a step in this continuing effort, I have decided to consolidate some of the District of Columbia educational authorities and services, and to strengthen the role of the District Government in the area of postsecondary education. One such consolidation and strengthening is this Reorganization Plan, and the accompanying proposed amended regulations for proprietary schools.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">In general, the proprietary schools have served the community well. They have provided trade, technical and self-improvement instruction beyond the high school level to students who did not seek a college education, but who aspired to careers requiring other kinds of knowledge, skills, and abilities. In many instances, these students became employable by this instruction, and upwardly mobile in their chosen field of work. Thus, the proprietary schools provide a service that has important results for the economy of the District, as well as the lives of individual citizens.</span>
                
                </p>

                <p>
                
                    <span class="" style="">However, experience has shown that the provision of poor instruction or unexpected closure by a few such schools can have a serious harmful effect on the students. Students typically borrow significant amounts to pay tuition, and if they are left with unmarketable skills or a prematurely terminated education, they may be worse off than before matriculation. In such cases, the individual and his or her family suffers. So too do the other schools, who rely on their reputations to do business. And so too, does the District of Columbia, which loses not only the opportunity for adding to the available skilled work force, but also the opportunity for decreasing the demand for financial assistance to unemployed or underemployed residents.</span>
                
                </p>

                    <span class="" style="">For these reasons, it has become clear that strengthening the regulation of proprietary schools is in the public interest. Therefore, I have decided to transfer this function to the Educational Institution Licensure Commission, and change its name to the Education Licensure Commission. The Commission now licenses and regulates private institutions that offer college level education, and serves as the State Approving Agency for education programs eligible for veterans who get assistance from the Veterans Administration. The Commission members are qualified members of the higher education profession, with experience and expertise in regulating postsecondary educational institutions. The Commission has a fine record of protecting the community from college level diploma mills, and improving the education available to citizens of the District of Columbia.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">In considering this additional assignment, the Commission has determined that amendments to the existing regulations are required. The Commission has prepared proposed amended regulations, which provide new educational criteria for licensing, new requirements for student records, and new authority for monitoring schools&#39; compliance with the regulations. All of the business licensing requirements are retained. These proposed amended regulations are transmitted with this Plan for Council approval.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1988, which would consolidate within the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) functions related to licensing and regulating security officers and private detectives, is the result of several years of planning between the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA) and the Metropolitan Police Department. The need for this reorganization grew out of the original rationale for establishing DCRA. This rationale was to create a central location in the District of Columbia to register and license businesses, individuals and activities.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">In DCRA&#39;s &quot;One-Stop&quot; center for business licensing, the objective or centralizing the licensure functions could not be achieved for security officers and private detectives because of the various approvals needed from MPD. These approvals and fingerprinting were performed at three separate locations outside of DCRA&#39;s offices.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Now MPD&#39;s Security Officers Management Branch is located at the Reeves Center on 14th and U Streets, N.W. Thus, with this reorganization all the licensing functions will be in one location for security officers and private detectives. The reorganization will effectively eliminate the current division of regulatory functions by consolidating these functions within MPD. The result of this consolidation will be to streamline the administration and enforcement of these two business activities. In order to sufficiently carry out these consolidated functions, MPD will augment it&#39;s staff by four (4) new clerk positions.</span>
