By Mayor&#39;s Order 85-152, dated September 12, 1985, I delegated my authority to administer the Act to the Director of the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs. Since I issued that Order, however, it has become clear that it should be modified to coincide more clearly with the respective functions of, and projects managed by, the Departments of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs and Public Works.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">In particular, I believe a reorganization to permit Public Works to issue grants for projects related to, or affecting, the Blue Plains Wastewater Treatment Plant and the improvement of water quality in the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers will result in a more efficient utilization of departmental resources and staff. While the missions and responsibilities of the two departments are related, often closely, Public Works is most knowledgeable of the time, program requirements, technical support and other constraints associated with projects such as the combined sewer abatement program and the Anacostia River cleanup effort. These and similar programs impact upon the operation and plant processes of Blue Plains and the requirements imposed upon the District under the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permit issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">The federal government contributes 55 percent (and in the past contributed 75 percent) of the cost of various construction and water quality projects. The application process often entails a series of deadlines and submittal requirements uniquely and readily within the Public Works&#39; purview. Therefore, in order to maximize the District&#39;s responsiveness to both federal grant application requirements and the subsequent release of such funds to District&#39;s grantees, I am proposing a reorganization to permit Public Works and Consumer and Regulatory Affairs to share the grant making authority set forth in Section 13 (D.C. Code § 6-932 [8-103.12]) of the Act.</span>

                <p>
                
                    <span class="" style="">Under this proposed change, Consumer and Regulatory Affairs will still have authority to issue grants for projects which fall under its responsibilities as the state regulatory agency for the District of Columbia. Public Works will have authority to issue grants for research related to the construction and monitoring of public facilities designed to improve water quality. Apart from the sharing of authority, no other changes are necessitated by this reorganization. Both departments will continue to obtain federal grants within their existing office structures and will issue grants to local recipients. Consequently, while no reduction in expenditures is contemplated, neither will expenditures increase, because both departments will utilized current staff to administer grant fund.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">The assignment of these duties jointly to the two departments administering the District&#39;s environmental programs and responsibilities ultimately will ensure the public health and safety and the quality of District and regional waters; and there will be no additional burden upon District resources.</span>
