Although the unclaimed property program produces revenue for the District, it is not a tax program. Instead, it is more appropriately characterized first, as a financial management and fiduciary service which the District renders to persons who have abandoned their property within our jurisdiction and then second, as a program that generates revenue for the District. Consequently, it is more efficient to place the program in the office that is charged with the management and control of the District&#39;s financial affairs.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">The tourism industry is the heartbeat of private enterprise in the District of Columbia. Tourism is responsible for generating approximately $3 billion dollars in the District in annual revenues. The tourist industry generates much of the activity and business of our city and, for that reason, it is a priority in my economic development strategy.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">More than 19 million visitors came to Washington, D.C. in 1991 for vacation purposes. Those leisure visitors who stay overnight, stay in Washington an average of 2.9 nights. An estimated 1.68 million of these overnight leisure visitors stay in the District of Columbia hotels producing 2,230,000 hotel room nights for the city. In addition to dollars spent in over 88 hotels, these visitors spend millions of dollars in the District of Columbia retail establishments, restaurants, theaters and on city transportation.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">While our neighboring jurisdictions become more aggressive, the District cannot afford to stand still. The Office of Tourism and Promotions will work to make Washington, D.C., visitor-friendly. We must help neighborhoods become more aware of strategies to encourage visitors to move away from the monumental core and visit the other sections of the District. The government will place more signs in key locations to direct and inform the visitors. We must establish a first class visitor&#39;s center; we have to provide more parking for tour buses, and information for those who use tour bus companies.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">The District of Columbia cannot rest on its laurels; nor can this government wait for business and leisure travellers to come to our city. The pursuit of the travel dollar is becoming an increasingly competitive strategy among U.S. jurisdictions and international destinations. The state of Virginia spends 10 million dollars annually on tourism promotions. It is no accident that we are familiar with its theme &quot;Virginia is for Lovers.&quot; Their national and international advertising budget is $5.5 million, almost 5 times the amount of money expended by the District of Columbia government.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">It is no accident that we know New York state&#39;s theme &quot;I Love New York.&quot; Approximately ten years ago in the midst of a spate of negative publicity about the safety of New York City, the state legislators voted to support a phenomenal increase in tourism promotion dollars. This action successfully increased the number of visitors and revenue they generated.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">This administration will promote tourism as a vehicle for increasing the tax base. It is estimated that tourism generates over $235 million in tax revenue for the District of Columbia each year. This is new money, completely derived from outside sources, that is poured into Washington&#39;s coffers. These funds are used to improve the quality of life for all District residents.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">We have to encourage Washington Dulles International Airport to solicit more international flights that bring high spending visitors to our Nation&#39;s Capital. We are reviewing our tour guide examination process which is more than 20 years old. We must inform our taxi drivers, our police, our parking enforcement officers and other front line personnel that tourism is good for our city. Our visitors must be treated with courtesy and respect to encourage travellers to return. These are programs the Office of Tourism and Promotions will coordinate.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">The District Government must spend more dollars on tourism promotion. I appreciate the Council&#39;s support of $700,000 in general revenue funds to be appropriated to the Washington Convention Center Enterprise Fund. These funds will be used by the D.C. Committee to Promote Washington to sustain the Committee&#39;s national and international advertising campaigns. I know the Council realizes that even with this appropriation, the District of Columbia will rank barely thirtieth (30th) out of fifty (50) states in comparison to the amount of money expended by other states on advertising. During the next fiscal year, we hope to come up with a city theme that will be adopted by individual hotels and businesses who will do their part to promote Washington, D.C., as a place to visit in the minds of potential travellers.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">I have frequently stated my desire to make Washington, D.C., an entertainment hub. My enthusiasm for this industry is rooted in the economic benefits of entertainment-related activities. We must do a better job of promoting those entertainment venues like the Kennedy Center, the National Theatre, and Carter Barron. We must bring more international sporting events to our city, e.g., World Cup Soccer and Tour Du Pont. These events generate dollars and provide recreation for our residents and visitors. These events also create contracting opportunities for District based businesses and jobs for city residents.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Because our society is fascinated with sports and entertainment, media outlets tend to cover these events more. World Cup Soccer will be viewed internationally by an estimated 26 billion viewers. The District could not, on its own, afford to purchase that kind of advertising. Tour Du Pont, in its first year in Washington, D.C., was carried by CBS sports and ESPN cable live, reaching more than 10 million households.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Several motion pictures have been filmed in Washington, D.C., as a result of the successful efforts of the Mayor&#39;s Office of Motion Picture and Television Development. When productions are filmed here, revenue is generated for electricians, make-up artists, sound mixers, video companies, construction crews, truckers, caterers, etc. In addition, because of Washington&#39;s distinctive skyline, filming in our city also advertises the unique attractions of our city. The City Council wisely voted to expand staffing and increase our capacity to generate over $30 million in annual revenues for local businesses and the District&#39;s revenue fund.</span>
