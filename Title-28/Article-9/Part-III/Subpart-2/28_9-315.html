Subsection (a)(1), which derives from former <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-306.html'>Section 9-306(2)</a>, contains the general rule that a security interest survives disposition of the collateral. In these cases, the secured party may repossess the collateral from the transferee or, in an appropriate case, maintain an action for conversion. The secured party may claim both any proceeds and the original collateral but, of course, may have only one satisfaction.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">In many cases, a purchaser or other transferee of collateral will take free of a security interest, and the secured party&#39;s only right will be to proceeds. For example, the general rule does not apply, and a security interest does not continue in collateral, if the secured party authorized the disposition, in the agreement that contains the security agreement or otherwise. Subsection (a)(1) adopts the view of PEB Commentary No. 3 and makes explicit that the authorized disposition to which it refers is an authorized disposition &quot;free of&quot; the security interest or agricultural lien. The secured party&#39;s right to proceeds under this section or under the express terms of an agreement does not in itself constitute an authorization of disposition. The change in language from former <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-306.html'>Section 9-306(2)</a> is not intended to address the frequently litigated situation in which the effectiveness of the secured party&#39;s consent to a disposition is conditioned upon the secured party&#39;s receipt of the proceeds. In that situation, subsection (a) leaves the determination of authorization to the courts, as under former Article 9.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">This Article contains several provisions under which a transferee takes free of a security interest or agricultural lien. For example, <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-317.html'>Section 9-317</a> states when transferees take free of unperfected security interests; Sections 9-320 and 9-321 on goods, 9-321 on general intangibles, 9-330 on chattel paper and instruments, and 9-331 on negotiable instruments, negotiable documents, and securities state when purchasers of such collateral take free of a security interest, even though perfected and even though the disposition was not authorized. Section 9-332 enables most transferees (including non-purchasers) of funds from a deposit account and most transferees of money to take free of a perfected security interest in the deposit account or money.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Likewise, the general rule that a security interest survives disposition does not apply if the secured party entrusts goods collateral to a merchant who deals in goods of that kind and the merchant sells the collateral to a buyer in ordinary course of business. <a href='/dccode/Title-2/Chapter-4/Subchapter-I/2-403.html'>Section 2-403(2)</a> gives the merchant the power to transfer all the secured party&#39;s rights to the buyer, even if the sale is wrongful as against the secured party. Thus, under subsection (a)(1), an entrusting secured party runs the same risk as any other entruster.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">3. Secured Party&#39;s Right to Identifiable Proceeds. Under subsection (a)(2), which derives from former <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-306.html'>Section 9-306(2)</a>, a security interest attaches to any identifiable &quot;proceeds,&quot; as defined in Section 9-102. See also Section 9-203(f). Subsection (b) is new. It indicates when proceeds commingled with other property are identifiable proceeds and permits the use of whatever methods of tracing other law permits with respect to the type of property involved. Among the &quot;equitable principles&quot; whose use other law may permit is the &quot;lowest intermediate balance rule.&quot; See Restatement (2d), Trusts s 202.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">4. Automatic Perfection in Proceeds: General Rule. Under subsection (c), a security interest in proceeds is a perfected security interest if the security interest in the original collateral was perfected. This Article extends the period of automatic perfection in proceeds from 10 days to 20 days. Generally, a security interest in proceeds becomes unperfected on the 21st day after the security interest attaches to the proceeds. See subsection (d). The loss of perfected status under subsection (d) is prospective only. Compare, e.g., Section 9-515(c) (deeming security interest unperfected retroactively).</span>

                    <span class="" style="">5. Automatic Perfection in Proceeds: Proceeds Acquired with Cash Proceeds. Subsection (d)(1) derives from former <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-306.html'>Section 9-306(3)(a)</a>. It carries forward the basic rule that a security interest in proceeds remains perfected beyond the period of automatic perfection if a filed financing statement covers the original collateral (e.g., inventory) and the proceeds are collateral in which a security interest may be perfected by filing in the office where the financing statement has been filed (e.g., equipment). A different rule applies if the proceeds are acquired with cash proceeds, as is the case if the original collateral (inventory) is sold for cash (cash proceeds) that is used to purchase equipment (proceeds). Under these circumstances, the security interest in the equipment proceeds remains perfected only if the description in the filed financing indicates the type of property constituting the proceeds (e.g., &quot;equipment&quot;).</span>

                    <span class="" style="">This section reaches the same result but takes a different approach. It recognizes that the treatment of proceeds acquired with cash proceeds under former <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-306.html'>Section 9-306(3)(a)</a> essentially was superfluous. In the example, had the filing covered &quot;equipment&quot; as well as &quot;inventory,&quot; the security interest in the proceeds would have been perfected under the usual rules governing after-acquired equipment (see former Sections 9-302, 9-303); paragraph (3)(a) added only an exception to the general rule. Subsection (d)(1)(C) of this section takes a more direct approach. It makes the general rule of continued perfection inapplicable to proceeds acquired with cash proceeds, leaving perfection of a security interest in those proceeds to the generally applicable perfection rules under subsection (d)(3).</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Example 1: Lender perfects a security interest in Debtor&#39;s inventory by filing a financing statement covering &quot;inventory.&quot; Debtor sells the inventory and deposits the buyer&#39;s check into a deposit account. Debtor draws a check on the deposit account and uses it to pay for equipment. Under the &quot;lowest intermediate balance rule,&quot; which is a permitted method of tracing in the relevant jurisdiction, see Comment 3, the funds used to pay for the equipment were identifiable proceeds of the inventory. Because the proceeds (equipment) were acquired with cash proceeds (deposit account), subsection (d)(1) does not extend perfection beyond the 20-day automatic period.</span>

Under the &quot;lowest intermediate balance rule,&quot; which is a permitted method of tracing in the relevant jurisdiction, see Comment 3, the funds used to pay for the equipment were identifiable proceeds of the inventory. Because the proceeds (equipment) were acquired with cash proceeds (deposit account), subsection (d)(1) does not extend perfection beyond the 20-day automatic period. However, because the financing statement is sufficient to perfect a security interest in debtor&#39;s equipment, under subsection (d)(3) the security interest in the equipment proceeds remains perfected beyond the 20-day period.</span>

Subsection (e) provides that a security interest in proceeds perfected under subsection (d)(1) ceases to be perfected when the financing statement covering the original collateral lapses or is terminated. If the lapse or termination occurs before the 21st day after the security interest attaches, however, the security interest in the proceeds remains perfected until the 21st day. <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-311.html'>Section 9-311(b)</a> provides that compliance with the perfection requirements of a statute or treaty described in <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-311.html'>Section 9-311(a)</a> &quot;is equivalent to the filing of a financing statement.&quot; It follows that collateral subject to a security interest perfected by such compliance under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-311.html'>Section 9-311(b)</a> is covered by a &quot;filed financing statement&quot; within the meaning of <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-315.html'>Section 9-315(d)</a> and (e).</span>

Former <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-306.html'>Section 9-306(3)(b)</a> provided that if a filed financing statement covered original collateral, a security interest in identifiable cash proceeds of the collateral remained perfected beyond the ten-day period of automatic perfection. Former <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-306.html'>Section 9-306(3)(c)</a> contained a similar rule with respect to identifiable cash proceeds of investment property. Subsection (d)(2) extends the benefits of former Sections 9-306(3)(b) and (3)(c) to identifiable cash proceeds of all types of original collateral in which a security interest is perfected by any method. Under subsection (d)(2), if the security interest in the original collateral was perfected, a security interest in identifiable cash proceeds will remain perfected indefinitely, regardless of whether the security interest in the original collateral remains perfected. In many cases, however, a purchaser or other transferee of the cash proceeds will take free of the perfected security interest. See, e.g., Sections 9-330(d) (purchaser of check), 9-331 (holder in due course of check), 9-332 (transferee of money or funds from a deposit account).</span>
