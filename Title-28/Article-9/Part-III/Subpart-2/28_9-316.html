                    <span class="" style="">2. Continued Perfection. This section deals with continued perfection of security interests that have been perfected under the law of another jurisdiction. The fact that the law of a particular jurisdiction ceases to govern perfection under Sections 9-301 through 9-307 does not necessarily mean that a security interest perfected under that law automatically becomes unperfected. To the contrary: This section generally provides that a security interest perfected under the law of one jurisdiction remains perfected for a fixed period of time (four months or one year, depending on the circumstances), even though the jurisdiction whose law governs perfection changes. However, cessation of perfection under the law of the original jurisdiction cuts short the fixed period. The four-month and one-year periods are long enough for a secured party to discover in most cases that the law of a different jurisdiction governs perfection and to reperfect (typically by filing) under the law of that jurisdiction. If a secured party properly reperfects a security interest before it becomes unperfected under subsection (a), then the security interest remains perfected continuously thereafter. See subsection (b).</span>

Lender perfects a security interest in Debtor&#39;s equipment by filing in Pennsylvania on May 15, 2002.

Lender&#39;s security interest remains perfected only through May 14, 2007, when the effectiveness of the filed financing statement lapses. See subsection (a)(1). Although, under these facts, Lender would have only a short period of time to discover that Debtor had relocated and to reperfect under New Jersey law, Lender could have protected itself by filing a continuation statement in Pennsylvania before Debtor relocated. By doing so, Lender would have prevented lapse and allowed itself the full four months to discover Debtor&#39;s new location and refile there or, if Debtor is in default, to perfect by taking possession of the equipment.</span>

Debtor&#39;s shareholders decide to &quot;reincorporate&quot; in Delaware. They form a Delaware corporation (Newcorp) into which they merge Debtor. The merger effectuates a transfer of the collateral from Debtor to Newcorp, which thereby becomes a debtor and is located in another jurisdiction. Under subsection (a)(3), the security interest remains perfected for one year after the merger. If a financing statement is filed in Delaware against Newcorp within the year following the merger, then the security interest remains perfected thereafter for a period determined by Delaware&#39;s Article 9.</span>

See Section 9-203. After the merger, Newcorp acquires inventory to which Lender&#39;s security interest attaches. Because Newcorp is located in Delaware, Delaware law governs perfection of a security interest in Newcorp&#39;s inventory. See Sections 9-301, 9-307. Having failed to perfect under Delaware law, Lender holds an unperfected security interest in the inventory acquired by Newcorp after the merger. The same result follows regardless of the name of the Delaware corporation (i.e., even if the Delaware corporation and Debtor have the same name). A different result would occur if Debtor and Newcorp were incorporated in the same state.

                    <span class="" style="">3. Retroactive Unperfection. Subsection (b) sets forth the consequences of the failure to reperfect before perfection ceases under subsection (a): the security interest becomes unperfected prospectively and, as against purchasers for value, including buyers and secured parties, but not as against donees or lien creditors, retroactively. The rule applies to agricultural liens, as well. See also Section 9-515 (taking the same approach with respect to lapse). Although this approach creates the potential for circular priorities, the alternative - retroactive unperfection against lien creditors - would create substantial and unjustifiable preference risks.</span>

However, subsection (b) provides that if Lender fails to reperfect in Delaware within a year after the merger, its security interest becomes unperfected and is deemed never to have been perfected against Buyer. Having given value and received delivery of the equipment without knowledge of the security interest and before it was perfected, Buyer would take free of the security interest. See <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-317.html'>Section 9-317(b)</a>.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Example 7: Under the facts of Example 4, one month before the merger, Debtor created a security interest in certain equipment in favor of Financer, who perfected by filing in Pennsylvania. At that time, Financer&#39;s security interest is subordinate to Lender&#39;s. See <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-322.html'>Section 9-322(a)(1)</a>. Financer reperfects by filing in Delaware within a year after the merger, but Lender fails to do so. Under subsection (b), Lender&#39;s security interest is deemed never to have been perfected against Financer, a purchaser for value. Consequently, under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-322.html'>Section 9-322(a)(2)</a>, Financer&#39;s security interest is now senior.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Of course, the expiration of the time period specified in subsection (a) does not of itself prevent the secured party from later reperfecting under the law of the new jurisdiction. If the secured party does so, however, there will be a gap in perfection, and the secured party may lose priority as a result. Thus, in Example 7, if Lender perfects by filing in Delaware more than one year under the merger, it will have a new date of filing and perfection for purposes of <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-322.html'>Section 9-322(a)(1)</a>. Financer&#39;s security interest, whose perfection dates back to the filing in Pennsylvania under subsection (b), will remain senior.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Example 8: Debtor&#39;s automobile is covered by a certificate of title issued by Illinois. Lender perfects a security interest in the automobile by complying with Illinois&#39; certificate-of-title statute. Thereafter, Debtor applies for a certificate of title in Indiana. Six months thereafter, Creditor acquires a judicial lien on the automobile. Under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-303.html'>Section 9-303(b)</a>, Illinois law ceases to govern perfection; rather, once Debtor delivers the application and applicable fee to the appropriate Indiana authority, Indiana law governs. Nevertheless, under Indiana&#39;s <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-316.html'>Section 9-316(d)</a>, Lender&#39;s security interest remains perfected until it would become unperfected under Illinois law had no certificate of title been issued by Indiana. (For example, Illinois&#39; certificate-of-title statute may provide that the surrender of an Illinois certificate of title in connection with the issuance of a certificate of title by another jurisdiction causes a security interest noted thereon to become unperfected.) If Lender&#39;s security interest remains perfected, it is senior to Creditor&#39;s judicial lien.</span>

Under subsection (e)(2), because Lender did not reperfect within the four months after the goods became covered by the Indiana certificate of title, Lender&#39;s security interest is deemed never to have been perfected against Buyer. Under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-317.html'>Section 9-317(b)</a>, Buyer is likely to take free of the security interest. Lender could have protected itself by perfecting its security interest either under Indiana&#39;s certificate-of-title statute, see <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-311.html'>Section 9-311</a>, or, if it had a right to do so under an agreement or Section 9-609, by taking possession of the automobile.

                    <span class="" style="">Example 10: Supplier holds an agricultural lien on corn. The lien arises under an Iowa statute. Supplier perfects by filing a financing statement in Iowa, where the corn is located. See <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-302.html'>Section 9-302</a>. Debtor stores the corn in Missouri. Assume the Iowa agricultural lien survives or an agricultural lien arises under Missouri law (matters that this Article does not govern). Once the corn is located in Missouri, Missouri becomes the jurisdiction whose law governs perfection. See <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-302.html'>Section 9-302</a>. Thus, the agricultural lien will not be perfected unless Supplier files a financing statement in Missouri.</span>
