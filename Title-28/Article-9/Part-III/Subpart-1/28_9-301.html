                    <span class="" style="">2. Scope of This Subpart. Part 3, Subpart 1 (Sections 9-301 through 9-307) contains choice-of-law rules similar to those of former Section 9-103. Former Section 9-103 generally addresses which State&#39;s law governs &quot;perfection and the effect of perfection or non-perfection of&quot; security interests. See, e.g., former Section 9-103(1)(b). This Article follows the broader and more precise formulation in former Section 9-103(6)(b), which was revised in connection with the promulgation of Revised Article 8 in 1994: &quot;perfection, the effect of perfection or non-perfection, and the priority of&quot; security interests. Priority, in this context, subsumes all of the rules in Part 3, including &quot;cut off&quot; or &quot;take free&quot; rules such as Sections 9-317(b), (c), and (d), 9-320(a), (b), and (d), and 9-332. This subpart does not address choice of law for other purposes. For example, the law applicable to issues such as attachment, validity, characterization (e.g., true lease or security interest), and enforcement is governed by the rules in <a href='/dccode/Title-1/Chapter-1/Subchapter-I/1-105.html'>Section 1-105</a>; that governing law typically is specified in the same agreement that contains the security agreement. And, another jurisdiction&#39;s law may govern other third-party matters addressed in this Article. See Section 9-401, Comment 3.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">3. Scope of Referral. In designating the jurisdiction whose law governs, this Article directs the court to apply only the substantive (&quot;local&quot;) law of a particular jurisdiction and not its choice-of-law rules.</span>
                
            
        </p>

                    <span class="" style="">Example 1: Litigation over the priority of a security interest in accounts arises in State X. State X has adopted the official text of this Article, which provides that priority is determined by the local law of the jurisdiction in which the debtor is located. See <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-301.html'>Section 9-301(1)</a>. The debtor is located in State Y. Even if State Y has retained former Article 9 or enacted a nonuniform choice-of-law rule (e.g., one that provides that perfection is governed by the law of State Z), a State X court should look only to the substantive law of State Y and disregard State Y&#39;s choice-of-law rule. State Y&#39;s substantive law (e.g., its <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-5/9-501.html'>Section 9-501</a>) provides that financing statements should be filed in a filing office in State Y. Note, however, that if the identical perfection issue were to be litigated in State Y, the court would look to State Y&#39;s former Section 9-103 or nonuniform 9-301 and conclude that a filing in State Y is ineffective.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Example 2: In the preceding Example, assume that State X has adopted the official text of this Article, and State Y has adopted a nonuniform <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-301.html'>Section 9-301(1)</a> under which perfection is governed by the whole law of State X, including its choice-of-law rules. If litigation occurs in State X, the court should look to the substantive law of State Y, which provides that financing statements are to be filed in a filing office in State Y. If litigation occurs in State Y, the court should look to the law of State X, whose choice-of-law rule requires that the court apply the substantive law of State Y. Thus, regardless of the jurisdiction in which the litigation arises, the financing statement should be filed in State Y.</span>

Paragraph (1) contains the general rule: the law governing perfection of security interests in both tangible and intangible collateral, whether perfected by filing or automatically, is the law of the jurisdiction of the debtor&#39;s location, as determined under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-307.html'>Section 9-307</a>.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Paragraph (1) substantially simplifies the choice-of-law rules. Former Section 9-103 contained different choice-of-law rules for different types of collateral. Under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-301.html'>Section 9-301(1)</a>, the law of a single jurisdiction governs perfection with respect to most types of collateral, both tangible and intangible. Paragraph (1) eliminates the need for former Section 9-103(1)(c), which concerned purchase-money security interests in tangible collateral that is intended to move from one jurisdiction to the other. It is likely to reduce the frequency of cases in which the governing law changes after a financing statement is properly filed. (Presumably, debtors change their own location less frequently than they change the location of their collateral.) The approach taken in paragraph (1) also eliminates some difficult priority issues and the need to distinguish between &quot;mobile&quot; and &quot;ordinary&quot; goods, and it reduces the number of filing offices in which secured parties must file or search when collateral is located in several jurisdictions.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">5. Law Governing Perfection: Exceptions. The general rule is subject to several exceptions. It does not apply to goods covered by a certificate of title (see <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-303.html'>Section 9-303</a>), deposit accounts (see <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-304.html'>Section 9-304</a>), investment property (see <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-305.html'>Section 9-305</a>), or letter-of-credit rights (see <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-306.html'>Section 9-306</a>). Nor does it apply to possessory security interests, i.e., security interests that the secured party has perfected by taking possession of the collateral (see paragraph (2)), security interests perfected by filing a fixture filing (see subparagraph (3)(A)), security interests in timber to be cut (subparagraph (3)(B)), or security interests in as-extracted collateral (see paragraph (4)).</span>
                
            
        </p>
    
        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">a. Possessory Security Interests. Paragraph (2) applies to possessory security interests and provides that perfection is governed by the local law of the jurisdiction in which the collateral is located. This is the rule of former Section 9-103(1)(b), except paragraph (2) eliminates the troublesome &quot;last event&quot; test of former law.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">The distinction between nonpossessory and possessory security interests creates the potential for the same jurisdiction to apply two different choice-of-law rules to determine perfection in the same collateral. For example, were a secured party in possession of an instrument or document to relinquish possession in reliance on temporary perfection, the applicable law immediately would change from that of the location of the collateral to that of the location of the debtor. The applicability of two different choice-of-law rules for perfection is unlikely to lead to any material practical problems. The perfection rules of one Article 9 jurisdiction are likely to be identical to those of another. Moreover, under paragraph (3), the relative priority of competing security interests in tangible collateral is resolved by reference to the law of the jurisdiction in which the collateral is located, regardless of how the security interests are perfected.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">b. Fixtures. Application of the general rule in paragraph (1) to perfection of a security interest in fixtures would yield strange results. For example, perfection of a security interest in fixtures located in Arizona and owned by a Delaware corporation would be governed by the law of Delaware. Although Delaware law would send one to a filing office in Arizona for the place to file a financing statement as a fixture filing, see <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-5/9-501.html'>Section 9-501</a>, Delaware law would not take account of local, nonuniform, real-property filing and recording requirements that Arizona law might impose. For this reason, paragraph (3)(A) contains a special rule for security interests perfected by a fixture filing; the law of the jurisdiction in which the fixtures are located governs perfection, including the formal requisites of a fixture filing. Under paragraph (3)(C), the same law governs priority. Fixtures are &quot;goods&quot; as defined in Section 9-102.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">c. Timber to Be Cut. Application of the general rule in paragraph (1) to perfection of a security interest in timber to be cut would yield undesirable results analogous to those described with respect to fixtures. Paragraph (3)(B) adopts a similar solution:</span>

        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">perfection is governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the timber is located. As with fixtures, under paragraph (3)(C), the same law governs priority. Timber to be cut also is &quot;goods&quot; as defined in Section 9-102.</span>
                
            
        </p>
    
        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">Paragraph (3)(B) applies only to &quot;timber to be cut,&quot; not to timber that has been cut. Consequently, once the timber is cut, the general choice-of-law rule in paragraph (1) becomes applicable. To ensure continued perfection, a secured party should file in both the jurisdiction in which the timber to be cut is located and in the state where the debtor is located. The former filing would be with the office in which a real property mortgage would be filed, and the latter would be a central filing. See <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-5/9-501.html'>Section 9-501</a>.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">d. As-Extracted Collateral. Paragraph (4) adopts the rule of former Section 9-103(5) with respect to certain security interests in minerals and related accounts. Like security interests in fixtures perfected by filing a fixture filing, security interests in minerals that are as-extracted collateral are perfected by filing in the office designated for the filing or recording of a mortgage on the real property. For the same reasons, the law governing perfection and priority is the law of the jurisdiction in which the wellhead or minehead is located.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">6. Change in Law Governing Perfection. When the debtor changes its location to another jurisdiction, the jurisdiction whose law governs perfection under paragraph (1) changes, as well. Similarly, the law governing perfection of a possessory security interest in collateral under paragraph (2) changes when the collateral is removed to another jurisdiction. Nevertheless, these changes will not result in an immediate loss of perfection. See <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-316.html'>Section 9-316(a)</a>, (b).</span>

                    <span class="" style="">7. Law Governing Effect of Perfection and Priority: Goods, Documents, Instruments, Money, Negotiable Documents, and Tangible Chattel Paper. Under former Section 9-103, the law of a single jurisdiction governed both questions of perfection and those of priority. This Article generally adopts that approach. See paragraph (1). But the approach may create problems if the debtor and collateral are located in different jurisdictions. For example, assume a security interest in equipment located in Pennsylvania is perfected by filing in Illinois, where the debtor is located. If the law of the jurisdiction in which the debtor is located were to govern priority, then the priority of an execution lien on goods located in Pennsylvania would be governed by rules enacted by the Illinois legislature.</span>

        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">To address this problem, paragraph (3)(C) divorces questions of perfection from questions of &quot;the effect of perfection or nonperfection and the priority of a security interest.&quot; Under paragraph (3)(C), the rights of competing claimants to tangible collateral are resolved by reference to the law of the jurisdiction in which the collateral is located. A similar bifurcation applied to security interests in investment property under former Section 9-103(6). See <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-305.html'>Section 9-305</a>.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Paragraph (3)(C) applies the law of the situs to determine priority only with respect to goods (including fixtures), instruments, money, negotiable documents, and tangible chattel paper. Compare former Section 9-103(1), which applied the law of the location of the collateral to documents, instruments, and &quot;ordinary&quot; (as opposed to &quot;mobile&quot;) goods. This Article does not distinguish among types of goods. The ordinary/mobile goods distinction appears to address concerns about where to file and search, rather than concerns about priority. There is no reason to preserve this distinction under the bifurcated approach.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Particularly serious confusion may arise when the choice-of-law rules of a given jurisdiction result in each of two competing security interests in the same collateral being governed by a different priority rule. The potential for this confusion existed under former Section 9-103(4) with respect to chattel paper: Perfection by possession was governed by the law of the location of the paper, whereas perfection by filing was governed by the law of the location of the debtor. Consider the mess that would have been created if the language or interpretation of former <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-308.html'>Section 9-308</a> were to differ in the two relevant States, or if one of the relevant jurisdictions (e.g., a foreign country) had not adopted Article 9. The potential for confusion could have been exacerbated when a secured party perfected both by taking possession in the State where the collateral is located (State A) and by filing in the State where the debtor is located (State B)-a common practice for some chattel paper financers. By providing that the law of the jurisdiction in which the collateral is located governs priority, paragraph (3) substantially diminishes this problem.</span>

For example, it adopts the bifurcated approach for determining the law applicable to security interests in goods and other tangible collateral. See Comment 5.a., above. The Article contains a new rule specifying the location of non-U.S. debtors for purposes of this Part. The rule appears in <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-307.html'>Section 9-307</a> and is explained in the Reporters&#39; Comments following that section. Former Section 9-103(3)(c), which contained a special choice-of-law rule governing security interests created by debtors located in a non-U.S. jurisdiction, proved unsatisfactory and was deleted.</span>
