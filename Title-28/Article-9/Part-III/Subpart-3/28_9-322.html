                    <span class="" style="">2. Scope of This Section. In a variety of situations, two or more people may claim a security interest in the same collateral. This section states general rules of priority among conflicting security interests. As subsection (f) provides, the general rules in subsections (a) through (e) are subject to the rule in subsection (g) governing perfected agricultural liens and to the other rules in this Part of this Article. Rules that override this section include those applicable to purchase-money security interests (<a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-324.html'>Section 9-324</a>) and those qualifying for special priority in particular types of collateral. See, e.g., Section 9-327 (deposit accounts); Section 9-328 (investment property); Section 9-329 (letter-of-credit rights); Section 9-330 (chattel paper and instruments); Section 9-334 (fixtures). In addition, the general rules of sections (a) through (e) are subject to priority rules governing security interests arising under Articles 2, 2A, 4, and 5.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">3. General Rules. Subsection (a) contains three general rules. Subsection (a)(1) governs the priority of competing perfected security interests. Subsection (a)(2) governs the priority of competing security interests if one is perfected and the other is not. Subsection (a)(3) governs the priority of competing unperfected security interests. The rules may be regarded as adaptations of the idea, deeply rooted at common law, of a race of diligence among creditors. The first two rules are based on precedence in the time as of which the competing secured parties either filed their financing statements or obtained perfected security interests. Under subsection (a)(1), the first secured party who files or perfects has priority. Under subsection (a)(2), which is new, a perfected security interest has priority over an unperfected one. Under subsection (a)(3), if both security interests are unperfected, the first to attach has priority. Note that Section 9-709(b) may affect the application of subsection (a) to a filing that occurred before the effective date of this Article and which would be ineffective to perfect a security interest under former Article 9 but effective under this Article.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">4. Competing Perfected Security Interests. When there is more than one perfected security interest, the security interests rank according to priority in time of filing or perfection. &quot;Filing,&quot; of course, refers to the filing of an effective financing statement. &quot;Perfection&quot; refers to the acquisition of a perfected security interest, i.e., one that has attached and as to which any required perfection step has been taken. See Sections 9-308 and 9-309.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Example 1: On February 1, A files a financing statement covering a certain item of Debtor&#39;s equipment. On March 1, B files a financing statement covering the same equipment. On April 1, B makes a loan to Debtor and obtains a security interest in the equipment. On May 1, A makes a loan to Debtor and obtains a security interest in the same collateral. A has priority even though B&#39;s loan was made earlier and was perfected when made. It makes no difference whether A knew of B&#39;s security interest when A made its advance.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">The problem stated in Example 1 is peculiar to a notice-filing system under which filing may occur before the security interest attaches (see <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-5/9-502.html'>Section 9-502</a>). The justification for determining priority by order of filing lies in the necessity of protecting the filing system-that is, of allowing the first secured party who has filed to make subsequent advances without each time having to check for subsequent filings as a condition of protection. Note, however, that this first-to-file protection is not absolute. For example, <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-324.html'>Section 9-324</a> affords priority to certain purchase-money security interests, even if a competing secured party was the first to file or perfect.</span>

The collateral is in Debtor&#39;s possession, and neither security interest is perfected when the second advance is made. Whichever secured party first perfects its security interest (by taking possession of the collateral or by filing) takes priority. It makes no difference whether that secured party knows of the other security interest at the time it perfects its own.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">The rule of subsection (a)(1), affording priority to the first to file or perfect, applies to security interests that are perfected by any method, including temporarily (<a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-312.html'>Section 9-312</a>) or upon attachment (<a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-309.html'>Section 9-309</a>), even though there may be no notice to creditors or subsequent purchasers and notwithstanding any common-law rule to the contrary. The form of the claim to priority, i.e., filing or perfection, may shift from time to time, and the rank will be based on the first filing or perfection as long as there is no intervening period without filing or perfection.

On October 5, B files and thereby perfects a security interest that previously had attached to the same document. On October 10, A files. A has priority, even after the 20-day period expires, regardless of whether A knows of B&#39;s security interest when A files. A was the first to perfect and maintained continuous perfection or filing since the start of the 20-day period. However, the perfection of A&#39;s security interest extends only &quot;to the extent it arises for new value given.&quot; To the extent A&#39;s security interest secures advances made by A beyond the 20-day period, its security interest would be subordinate to B&#39;s, inasmuch as B was the first to file.</span>

It provides that the baseline rules of subsection (a) apply generally to priority conflicts in proceeds except where otherwise provided (e.g., as in subsections (c) through (e)). Under Section 9-203, attachment cannot occur (and therefore, under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-308.html'>Section 9-308</a>, perfection cannot occur) as to particular collateral until the collateral itself comes into existence and the debtor has rights in it. Thus, a security interest in proceeds of original collateral does not attach and is not perfected until the proceeds come into existence and the debtor acquires rights in them.</span>

The same day, A files a financing statement covering inventory. On May 1, Debtor authenticates a security agreement granting B a security interest in all Debtor&#39;s existing and future accounts. On June 1, Debtor sells inventory to a customer on 30-day unsecured credit. When Debtor acquires the account, B&#39;s security interest attaches to it and is perfected by B&#39;s financing statement. At the very same time, A&#39;s security interest attaches to the account as proceeds of the inventory and is automatically perfected. See <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-315.html'>Section 9-315</a>. Under subsection (b) of this section, for purposes of determining A&#39;s priority in the account, the time of filing as to the original collateral (April 1, as to inventory) is also the time of filing as to proceeds (account). Accordingly, A&#39;s security interest in the account has priority over B&#39;s. Of course, had B filed its financing statement before A filed (e.g., on March 1), then B would have priority in the accounts.</span>

Subsections (c), (d), and (e), which are new, provide additional priority rules for proceeds of collateral in situations where the temporal (first-in-time) rules of subsection (a)(1) are not appropriate. These new provisions distinguish what these Comments refer to as &quot;non-filing collateral&quot; from what they call &quot;filing collateral.&quot; As used in these Comments, non-filing collateral is collateral of a type for which perfection may be achieved by a method other than filing (possession or control, mainly) and for which secured parties who so perfect generally do not expect or need to conduct a filing search. More specifically, non-filing collateral is chattel paper, deposit accounts, negotiable documents, instruments, investment property, and letter-of-credit rights. Other collateral-accounts, commercial tort claims, general intangibles, goods, nonnegotiable documents, and payment intangibles-is filing collateral.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">8. Proceeds of Non-Filing Collateral: Non-Temporal Priority. Subsection (c)(2) provides a baseline priority rule for proceeds of non-filing collateral which applies if the secured party has taken the steps required for non-temporal priority over a conflicting security interest in non-filing collateral (e.g., control, in the case of deposit accounts, letter-of-credit rights, and investment property). This rule determines priority in proceeds of non-filing collateral whether or not there exists an actual conflicting security interest in the original non-filing collateral. Under subsection (c)(2), the priority in the original collateral continues in proceeds if the security interest in proceeds is perfected and the proceeds are cash proceeds or non-filing proceeds &quot;of the same type&quot; as the original collateral. As used in subsection (c)(2), &quot;type&quot; means a type of collateral defined in the Uniform Commercial Code and should be read broadly. For example, a security is &quot;of the same type&quot; as a security entitlement (i.e., investment property), and a promissory note is &quot;of the same type&quot; as a draft (i.e., an instrument).</span>

Debtor receives cash proceeds of the security (e.g., dividends deposited into Debtor&#39;s deposit account). If the first-to-file-or-perfect rule of subsection (a)(1) were applied, SP-1&#39;s security interest in the cash proceeds would be senior, although SP-2&#39;s security interest continues perfected under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-315.html'>Section 9-315</a> beyond the 20-day period of automatic perfection.

The inventory is sold and the proceeds deposited into another deposit account, as to which SP-1 has not obtained control. Subsection (c) does not govern priority in this other deposit account. This deposit account is cash proceeds and is also the same type of collateral as SP-1&#39;s original collateral, as required by subsections (c)(2)(A) and (B). However, SP-1&#39;s security interest does not satisfy subsection (c)(2)(C) because the inventory proceeds, which intervened between the original deposit account and the deposit account constituting the proceeds at issue, are not cash proceeds, proceeds of the same type as the collateral (original deposit account), or an account relating to the collateral. Stated otherwise, once proceeds other than cash proceeds, proceeds of the same type as the original collateral, or an account relating to the original collateral intervene in the chain of proceeds, priority under subsection (c) is thereafter unavailable. The special priority rule in subsection (d) also is inapplicable to this case. See Comment 9, Example 13, below. Instead, the general first-to-file-or-perfect rule of subsections (a) and (b) apply. Under that rule, SP-1 has priority unless its security interest in the inventory proceeds became unperfected under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-315.html'>Section 9-315(d)</a>. Had SP-2 filed against inventory before SP-1 obtained control of the original deposit account, the SP-2 would have had priority even if SP-1&#39;s security interest in the inventory proceeds remained perfected.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">9. Proceeds of Non-Filing Collateral: Special Temporal Priority. Under subsections (d) and (e), if a security interest in non-filing collateral is perfected by a method other than filing (e.g., control or possession), it does not retain its priority over a conflicting security interest in proceeds that are filing collateral. Moreover, it is not entitled to priority in proceeds under the first-to file-or-perfect rule of subsections (a)(1) and (b). Instead, under subsection (d), priority is determined by a new first-to-file rule.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Example 12: SP-1 perfects its security interest in Debtor&#39;s deposit account by obtaining control. Thereafter, SP-2 files against equipment, (presumably) searches, finds no indication of a conflicting security interest, and advances against Debtor&#39;s equipment. SP-1 then files against Debtor&#39;s equipment. Debtor uses funds from the deposit account to purchase equipment, which SP-1 can trace as proceeds of its security interest in Debtor&#39;s deposit account. If the first-to-file-or-perfect rule were applied, SP-1&#39;s security interest would be senior under subsections (a)(1) and (b), because it was the first to perfect in the original collateral and there was no period during which its security interest was unperfected. Under subsection (d), however, SP-2&#39;s security interest would be senior because it filed first. This corresponds with the likely expectations of the parties.</span>

Under subsections (b)(2) and (c)(1), a security interest having priority in collateral also has priority in a supporting obligation for that collateral. However, the rules in these subsections are subject to the special rule in Section 9-329 governing the priority of security interests in a letter-of-credit right. See subsection (f). Under Section 9-329, a secured party&#39;s failure to obtain control (Section 9-107) of a letter-of-credit right that serves as supporting collateral leaves its security interest exposed to a priming interest of a party who does take control.</span>

This rule may be of merely theoretical interest, inasmuch as it is hard to imagine a situation where the case would come into litigation without either secured party&#39;s having perfected its security interest. If neither security interest had been perfected at the time of the filing of a petition in bankruptcy, ordinarily neither would be good against the trustee in bankruptcy under the Bankruptcy Code.</span>

Statutes other than this Article may purport to grant priority to an agricultural lien as against a conflicting security interest or agricultural lien.
