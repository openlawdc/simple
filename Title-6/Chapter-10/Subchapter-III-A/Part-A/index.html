The report recommended the formation of one or more community land trusts run by public, nonprofit, or other community-based entities whose mission would be to acquire land and hold it long-term while providing long-term leases to developers of housing for both rental and for-sale units. This approach advances the important objective of creating &#39;permanent affordability&quot; or guaranteeing that units remain affordable indefinitely.</span>
