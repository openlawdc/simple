For purposes of this subsection, &quot;transfer of control&quot; shall have occurred when 51% or more of the residential executive board is composed of residential unit owners other than the declarant, or successor declarant, or the declarant&#39;s selections or nominees. At the end of 5 years from the conveyance of the first residential unit to a purchaser, and provided one year has passed following transfer of control by the declarant, the declarant may sell unsold residential units as resale units, in which event no warranty against structural defects in the units under this section shall be required and the bond shall be reduced pro rata as to those unsold units. The bonding requirements pursuant to this subsection and the warranties required under this section are applicable only to residential condominiums or the residential condominium portion of mixed use condominiums or mixed use projects.

                    <span class="" style="">&quot;(e)(1) Prior to the declarant&#39;s first conveyance of a residential unit to a purchaser, the declarant shall post a bond or letter of credit with the Mayor in the amount of 10% of the estimated construction or conversion costs, or shall provide any other form of security the Mayor shall approve to satisfy any costs that arise from the declarant&#39;s failure to satisfy the requirements of this section. The other security may include a lien in favor of the Mayor against the declarant&#39;s equity in any unsold units, including any non-residential units, in which event the unsold units will be valued, for purposes of computing the declarant&#39;s equity, at 90% of the current listed sales price of the units, or if not listed, then the current listed sales price of comparable units in the condominium. The bond, letter of credit, or other security shall be reduced at the declarant&#39;s request in pro rata segments (based on the residential unit&#39;s percentage interest in the residential portion of the condominium) 2 years after the conveyance of each unit; provided, however, that in no event shall the security be reduced below 50% of the original amount of the security until one year after transfer of control of the residential executive board of the condominium association to purchasing residential unit owners other than the declarant. For purposes of this subsection, &#39;transfer of control&#39; shall have occurred when 51% or more of the residential executive board is composed of residential unit owners other than the declarant, or successor declarant, or the declarant&#39;s selections or nominees. At the end of 5 years from the conveyance of the first residential unit to a purchaser, and provided one year has passed following transfer of control by the declarant, the declarant may sell unsold residential units as resale units, in which event no warranty against structural defects in the units under this section shall be required and the bond shall be reduced pro rata as to those unsold units. The bonding requirements pursuant to this subsection and the warranties required under this section are applicable only to residential condominiums or the residential condominium portion of mixed use condominiums or mixed use projects. If residential condominium units are part of a mixed use condominium, the cost of the residential portion of the condominium shall include the residential condominium units&#39; pro rata share of common elements, based on the residential condominium units&#39; percentage interest in the common elements. If a residential condominium is part of a mixed use project, the cost of the residential condominium includes its pro rata share of those portions of the project directly supporting, enclosing or servicing the residential condominium.</span>

The bylaws and other condominium documents to be prepared by the declarant shall not restrict or hinder the residential executive board&#39;s right to assert claims under this section.&quot;</span>
