                    <span class="" style="">&quot;Beginning interest rate: means the interest rate the borrower pays at the beginning of the loan. In many types of loans, this rate is good for only a few years and may increase significantly.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">&quot;Fully indexed rate: is an indicator of what will happen to the interest rate on the loan and the monthly payments. It is today&#39;s estimate of how high the interest rate on an adjustable rate mortgage will go. It is calculated by taking a defined index rate and adding a certain number of percentage points, called the margin. Since the index rate can go up or down, the borrower cannot be sure what the future adjustable interest rate will be. Borrowers must make sure they can afford the fully indexed interest rate and not just the initial interest rate.</span>
