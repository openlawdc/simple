The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, <a href='http://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=statute&volume=87&page=818'>87 Stat. 818</a>, § 711 (D.C.

These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively.
