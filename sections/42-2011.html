Said petition may be served on the person designated in the bylaws in conformity with <a href='/simple/sections/42-2014.html'>§ 42-2014(a)(7)</a>.

If no cause be shown against the prayer of the petition by the council of co-owners, or by any one of the co-owners, the court may determine in a summary way whether the facts warrant termination and thereupon the court may decree the particular horizontal property regime terminated.</span>
