If the distributor does not make or cause to be made a good faith offer to repurchase the retail dealer&#39;s products and equipment within the 30-day period provided for in this subsection, the retail dealer or his legal representative may sell the products and equipment for as reasonable a price as may be obtained, may apply the balance owed by the distributor against any existing indebtedness owed by the retail dealer to the distributor, and shall have a cause of action against the distributor for the difference. In the event that the distributor repurchases the retail dealer&#39;s products and equipment the distributor shall have the right to first apply the value of the products and equipment being repurchased against any existing indebtedness owed directly to the distributor by the retail dealer. The distributor&#39;s obligation to repurchase shall be enforceable only to the extent that there are no other valid claims or liens against such products or equipment by or on behalf of other creditors of the retail dealer.</span>
