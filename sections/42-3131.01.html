A life-or-health threatening condition means a condition that imminently endangers the health or safety of the tenant or occupant of the premises in a housing unit or housing accommodation, or that imminently endangers the health, safety, or welfare of the surrounding community. The condition may include, but is not limited to, a vacant building, as defined in <a href='/simple/sections/42-3131.05.html'>§ 42-3131.05(5)</a>, or the interruption of electrical, heat, gas, water, or other essential services, when the interruption results from other than natural causes. The condition may also include the presence of graffiti. Except in the case of a vacant building, the Mayor shall notify promptly the owner or authorized agent that the correction is ordered within a specified time period. If at the time of this notice the owner is engaged in a good faith effort to make the necessary correction, the Mayor shall not commence corrective action unless and until the owner interrupts or ceases the effort. A good faith effort shall be one which is likely to cause the correction of the condition at least as soon as it could otherwise be corrected by the Mayor. The Mayor shall provide an opportunity for review of the summary corrective action without prejudice to the Mayor&#39;s authority to take and complete that action. The owner or authorized agent shall be notified by personal service or by registered mail to the last known address and by conspicuous posting on the property. If the owner or address is unknown, or cannot be located, notice shall be provided by conspicuous posting on the property. The Mayor may assess all reasonable costs of correcting the condition and all expenses incident thereto as a tax against the property, to carry this tax on the regular tax rolls, and to collect the tax in the same manner as real estate taxes are collected. Monies in the revolving fund established by subsection (b)(1) of this section shall be available to cover the costs of the summary correction authorized by this subsection.</span>
