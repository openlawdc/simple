                    <span class="" style="">Any property contained in the motor vehicle at the time of seizure may be held for evidentiary purposes until such time as the forfeiture proceeding is concluded, or the Corporation Counsel determines that the property is no longer needed for evidentiary purposes, whichever is sooner. Any property that is not needed for evidentiary purposes may be returned to the person who has a right of claim to the property. The Mayor may dispose of any solid waste contained in the motor vehicle at the time of seizure and collect up to 3 times the cost and expense incurred for the proper disposal. If it appears to the Mayor that any property seized under this section is liable to perish, waste, or be greatly reduced in value by the keeping, or that the expense of keeping is disproportionate to the value of the property, the Mayor may proceed to advertise and sell the property at auction or otherwise dispose of the property.</span>
