No refund (other than inheritance and estate taxes) shall be allowed after 2 years from the date the tax is paid unless the taxpayer files a claim before the expiration of that period. The amount of refund of taxes (other than inheritance and estate taxes) shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid during the 2 years immediately preceding the filing of the claim or, if no claim is filed, then the 2 years immediately preceding the allowance of the refund. No refund of inheritance and estate taxes shall be allowed after 3 years from the date the tax is paid unless the taxpayer files a claim before the expiration of that period. The amount of refund of inheritance and estate taxes shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid during the 3 years immediately preceding the filing of the claim or, if no claim is filed, then during the 3 years immediately preceding the allowance of the refund. Every claim for refund must be in writing under oath, must state the specific grounds on which it is founded, and must be filed with the Mayor. If the Mayor disallows all or any part of the refund claim, he shall notify the taxpayer by registered or certified mail. After receiving notice of disallowance, if the claim is acted upon within 6 months of filing, or after the expiration of 6 months from the date of filing if the claim is not acted upon, the taxpayer may appeal as provided in §<a href='/simple/sections/47-3303.html'>§ 47-3303</a> and 47-3304 of this title.
