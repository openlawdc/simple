Until the successor transfers all special declarant rights to any person who acquires title to any unit owned by the successor, or until the successor records an instrument that permits exercise of all special declarant rights, the successor may not exercise the special declarant rights other than a right held by his or her transferor to control the executive board in accordance with the provisions of <a href='/simple/sections/42-1903.02.html'>§&nbsp;42‑1903.02</a> for the duration of any period of declarant control. Any attempted exercise of special declarant rights other than a right held by the successor&#39;s transferor to control the executive board shall be void. For the period that a successor declarant may not exercise special declarant rights under this subsection, he or she shall not be subject to any liability or obligation as a declarant other than liability or obligation as a declarant for his or her acts or omissions under <a href='/simple/sections/42-1903.02.html'>§&nbsp;42‑1903.02</a>.</span>
