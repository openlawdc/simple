 (i) For purposes of this subsection, the following plan types apply: 
 
 
 &quot;Plan Type A&quot; means that, unless the company prohibits a withdrawal, the policyholder may withdraw funds with an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since the company received the funds; without adjustment, but in installments for 5 years or more; or as an immediate life annuity. 
 
 
 &quot;Plan Type B&quot; means that, before the interest rate guarantee expires, and unless the company prohibits a withdrawal, the policyholder may withdraw funds with an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since the company received the funds; without the adjustment, but in installments for 5 years or more; or, after the interest rate guarantee ends, in a lump sum without the adjustment or in installments lasting less than 5 years. 
 
 
 &quot;Plan Type C&quot; means that, before the interest rate guarantee expires, the policyholder may withdraw funds in a lump sum or in installments lasting less than 5 years, and either without the withdrawal being adjusted to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since the company received the funds or with the withdrawal subject only to a fixed surrender charge stipulated in the contract as a percentage of the fund.

 (vi) Where no cash settlement options apply to annuities or guaranteed interest contracts, the guarantee duration is the number of years from the issuance or the purchase date that the policy has scheduled the annuity benefits to begin. 
 
 (D) (i) A company may elect to value guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options and annuities with cash settlement options on either an issue year basis or on a change in fund basis. 
 
 (ii) Guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options and other annuities with no cash settlement options must be valued on an issue year basis. 
 
 (iii) An issue year basis of valuation refers to a valuation basis where the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard for the annuity or the guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the issuance year or purchase year. 
 
 (iv) The change in fund basis of valuation refers to a valuation basis where the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard for each change in the annuity or the guaranteed interest contract fund is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year that the fund changed. 
 
 (4) The reference interest rate referred to in paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be as follows: 
 
 (A) For all life insurance, the reference rate shall be the lesser between the average rate during a 36-month period and the average rate during a 12-month period ending June 30 of the calendar year preceding the issuance year. 
 
 (B) For single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising where cash settlement options apply to other annuities and to guaranteed interest contracts, the reference rate shall be the average rate during a 12-month period ending June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase. 
 
 (C) Where guarantee duration exceeds 10 years and where cash settlement options for annuities and for guaranteed interest contracts have values based upon the issuance year, the reference rate shall be the least between the average rate during a 36-month period and the average rate during a 12-month period ending June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase. 
 
 (D) Where guarantee duration does not exceed 10 years and where cash settlement options for annuities and for guaranteed interest contracts have values based upon the issuance year, the reference rate shall be the average rate during a 12-month period ending June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase. 
 
 (E) For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the reference rate shall be the average rate during a 12-month period ending June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase. 
 
 (F) Where cash settlement options apply to annuities and to guaranteed interest contracts and have values based on a change in the fund, the reference rate shall be the average rate during a 12-month period ending June 30 of the calendar year of the change in the fund. 
 
 (5) (A) Moody&#39;s Corporate Bond Yield Average - Monthly Average Corporate published by Moody&#39;s Investors Service, Inc., shall set the reference rates described in paragraph (4) of this subsection. 
 
 (B) If the National Association of Insurance Commissioners determines that Moody&#39;s Investors Service, Inc., is no longer an appropriate source for the reference rate, then an alternative method shall be adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and approved by the Commissioner.

                    <span class="" style="">Department of Insurance abolished: The Department of Insurance, including the Superintendent, was abolished and the functions thereof transferred to the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia by Reorganization Plan No. 5 of 1952. Reorganization Order No. 43, dated June 23, 1953, as amended, established, under the direction and control of a Commissioner, a Department of Insurance headed by a Superintendent. The Order provided for the organization of the Department, abolished the previously existing Department of Insurance, and provided that all functions and positions of the previous Department would be transferred to the new Department of Insurance, including the duties, powers, and authorities of all officers and employees; and that all personnel, property, records and unexpended balances relating to the functions and positions transferred would also be transferred to the new Department. The executive functions of the Board of Commissioners were transferred to the Commissioner of the District of Columbia by § 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967. The functions of the Superintendent of Insurance were transferred to the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs by Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1983, effective March 31, 1983. Pursuant to the provisions of <a href='http://openlims.org/public/L11-268.pdf'>D.C. Law 11-268</a>, the Department of Insurance and Securities Regulation was established and the duties of the Superintendent of Insurance and the Insurance Administration were assumed by the Commissioner of Insurance and Securities, and the Insurance Administration in the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs was abolished.</span>
